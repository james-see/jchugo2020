I am a husband, father, and technologist living near Washington DC.

I enjoy working on projects that merge art & code as well as making and listening to music.

Let's create the world we want.

The best way to follow along on my journey are the following:

1. Github as [jamesacampbell](https://github.com/jamesacampbell), which links to my twitter and other locations as well
2. Stackoverflow as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1215344/jamescampbell" target="_blank" >jamescampbell</a> (top 2% as of 2022).
3. GoldForLions which is my band on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4WnFnyJZWqwKMA5EfmYklZ?si=MWceRVNeT2GoliQ312JnEw).
