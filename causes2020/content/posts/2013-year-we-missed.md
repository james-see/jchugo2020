In 2013, we looked pretty ridiculous standing around staring at our phones, tablets, phablets, and iPads.

My goal in this post is to share photos I have curated that document the phenomenon of humans interacting with new technology.

Since I believe I am a better curator than writer, I will try to keep the words to a minimum.

New technology is great, but we need to figure out what it means and how it fits into our lives.

Were our lives more meaningful and rich when we were analog?

What can we do today to enable meaning in a world that expresses emotion through a like button?

The rise of hipster culture is an indication of our collective nostalgia for what we did before the cloud came along that digitized, monetized, and made available everything we want at a moments notice.

My wife and I have a rule: _no phones out at meals_. It is simple, but it really works. What other rules make sense?

### 2014 is the year we will start to figure it out.

2014 is the year we start finding smart uses for our technology that enable human connection, interaction, and sharing, as opposed to keeping us apart even when we are in the same room.

## Happy New Year!
