I used to love Google services and their policy of "don't be evil." The anagram solver tells me that the phrase turns into the word 'violented.' Well I definitely feel whatever that means.

I was a huge fan of Google Reader and Google Analytics. I even setup and managed google analytic accounts for websites that I created for clients. Not today.

_I do understand it is probably cliche in the ever-growing hipster-tech community to be anti-google but I really don't want to have my digital life attached to a single service where I am the product, which is also the reason I have a largely vacant Facebook account._

Here is what I have found out there to replace google (I am not getting paid to endorse any of these services, I just love them because they work the same or better than Google's version):

1. Google Reader <i class='fa fa-hand-o-right'></i> [TT-RSS][1]
2. Google Feedburner <i class='fa fa-hand-o-right'></i> [FeedPress][2] (formerly URI.LV)
3. Google Gmail <i class='fa fa-hand-o-right'></i> [Mail in a Box][3]
4. Google Drive <i class='fa fa-hand-o-right'></i> [NextCloud][4]
5. Google Docs <i class='fa fa-hand-o-right'></i> [FengOffice][5]
6. Google Analytics <i class='fa fa-hand-o-right'></i> [GoAccess][6]

_You run TT-RSS, NextCloud, and FengOffice on your own server with your own domain. For instance, I have my tt-rss installation at [jr.jamescampbell.us/tt-rss](https://jr.jamescampbell.us/tt-rss). If you need help setting this up, send me a message via one of my contact methods below._
