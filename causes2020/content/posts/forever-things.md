I love brass. Brass is a hard metal that will outlast me. It is strange to think about things that will exist after we are gone. I own a Kaweco pen that is brass. Assuming I buy ink refills, I never have to buy a pen again.

That is a single example that explains the idea behind this article. What thing can you acquire once, and then never have to buy a newer version again?

I came up with a list of 10 things that, if you make the right choice when purchasing, you should never have to buy again for your entire life. You may have to repair or buy parts for them, but you will never have to buy the full item again.

1. Toothbrush. I've had the [same electric toothbrush][3] for 10 years. No, that is not disgusting! I buy different heads for it periodically, but the charger still works really well, and I have no plans to buy anything else.
2. Wallet. I have a [Field Notes Leather wallet][4] that holds my notebook, pen, passport, and credit cards. It will definitely outlast me. Update: I procured a [brass cigarette case][5] that I am now using as a wallet.
3. Storage Trunk. Still searching.
4. Backpack. Still searching.
5. Suitcase. Still searching.
6. Briefcase. [Saddleback Leather Front Pocket Briefcase][1] 100 year warranty!
7. Boots. Still searching.
8. Shoes. Spend $200 to $700 on a nice pair of shoes and just re-sole them. You will never have to worry about shoes ever again.
9. Pens. I have this [Kaweco Sport Pocket Pen][2]. I never have to buy another again.
10. Watch. Still searching.
