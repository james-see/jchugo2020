I am in the process of rewriting most of my python code into golang projects. One of which that is already complete is  [gofindpi][1] that replaces the pypi package [findpi][2]

_Why am I doing this?_

I am convinced that, given enough learning time to get past the foibles of Golang, anything written in Golang will be better than Python, and this is an objective conclusion I came to, even though I will always love Python.
