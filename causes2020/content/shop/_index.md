**CleanPDF**

Clean PDF allows you to investigate PDFs for e-discovery, forensics, and authorship analysis.

It also allows you to wipe the metadata from PDFs that you create -- to ensure you aren't creating a unique fingerprint when you create and share a PDF to others.

It runs on Mac OS, and verified to work on Mojave, even in Dark Mode. Installation is as simple as unzipping the download and dragging into your Applications folder.
