<p>New technology is great, but we need to figure out what it means and how it fits into our lives.</p>
<p>Were our lives more meaningful and rich when we were analog?</p>
<p>What can we do today to enable meaning in a world that expresses emotion through a like button?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The rise of hipster culture is an indication of our collective nostalgia for what we did before the cloud came along that digitized, monetized, and made available everything we want at a moments notice.</p>
<p>My wife and I have a rule: <em>no phones out at meals</em>. It is simple, but it really works. What other rules make sense?</p>
