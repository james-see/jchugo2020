<p>Here is what I have found out there to replace google (I am not getting paid to endorse any of these services, I just love them because they work the same or better than Google&rsquo;s version):</p>
<ol>
<li>Google Reader <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="https://tt-rss.org/" title="Nice, easy install and lightweight rss feed manager and reader">TT-RSS</a></li>
<li>Google Feedburner <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="http://feedpress.it" title="Highly customizable, mine is running at feed.jamescampbell.us/jamescampbell">FeedPress</a> (formerly URI.LV)</li>
<li>Google Gmail <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="https://mailinabox.email" title="Yes, you can run your own email server.">Mail in a Box</a></li>
<li>Google Drive <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="https://nextcloud.com/install" title="your data your way, bonus points is it comes with Mail in a Box">NextCloud</a></li>
<li>Google Docs <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="http://www.fengoffice.com/web/professional_vs_community.php" title="Google docs and calendar and notes">FengOffice</a></li>
<li>Google Analytics <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess" title="Nice linux terminal interface in case you dont have web access">GoAccess</a></li>
</ol>
<p><em>You run TT-RSS, NextCloud, and FengOffice on your own server with your own domain. For instance, I have my tt-rss installation at <a href="https://jr.jamescampbell.us/tt-rss">jr.jamescampbell.us/tt-rss</a>. If you need help setting this up, send me a message via one of my contact methods below.</em></p>
