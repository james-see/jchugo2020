        <p>I&rsquo;ve complained about Flickr&rsquo;s new redesign enough. There are some positives about the service that still out-do any other online photo sharing website.</p>
<p>For example, I am one of the lucky ones who have been grandfathered into Flickr&rsquo;s unlimited photo plan when my Pro plan was renewed earlier this year. This means that for $25 per year I get <em>unlimited</em> photo storage.</p>
<p><img src="/img/flickr-backup.png" alt="screenshot of flickr unlimited available"></p>
<p>This fact, coupled with the auto-upload feature in the Flickr app for the iPhone means I have everything I need to backup and store all of my photos taken on my iPhone.</p>
<p>Once I tested this system and used it for the last week, I turned off Photo Stream on my iPhone.</p>
<p><em>Updated workflow on iPhone is as follows:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Take a photo.</li>
<li>Next time I open the Flickr app, all of my photos are there.</li>
<li>All done. I can download again, edit, publish anytime I wish.</li>
</ol>
<p>The photos are automatically set as private until I decide to publish. That is it. No messing with sending to <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://www.loom.com">Loom</a>, Everpix (now defunct), or trying to rely on the 1000 photo limit of Photo Stream to force me to get to the photos before they disappear into the aether.</p>
<p>If you are looking to use something other than Flickr, I recommend <a href="http://www.loom.com">Loom</a>.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loom is a place for all your photos and videos.
One library, seamlessly organized and accessible from anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I said on twitter, Loom is what Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4486">My Photo Stream</a> should be.</p>
